/*
Cluster and Caching â€“ HANDS-on activity
------------------------------------------
Activities:
============
Note: Ensure you have a database, a schema and warehouse selected in the GUI before starting this activity.

In this exercise, we will be creating one large un-clustered table and one large clustered table, with clustering key on a date column.
We will review the query-profile for queries against these tables a range of dates.

Next, we will also experiment on how Snowflake enhances performances using all the three types of caches.

---- Creating a seed table from which we will create the required large tables for the exercise

AS
    SELECT DATEADD( day, '-' || ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY null),
                        DATEADD(day, '+1', current_date())) AS transaction_date,
          ABS(MOD(RANDOM(1), 10000)) +1 AS customer_id,
          ABS(MOD(RANDOM(1), 21010)) +1 AS transaction_id,
          ABS(MOD(RANDOM(1), 100)) +1 AS amount

-- Navigate to the history tab and filter based on query_tag with the value you set above.

-- Now, execute the same SQL in succession twice and review the Query-profile from the History tab.
